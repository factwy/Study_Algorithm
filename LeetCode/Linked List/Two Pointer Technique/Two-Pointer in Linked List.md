# Two-Pointer in Linked List

- **Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it**

**the two-pointer technique** is a more efficient solution
1. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will stop at the end of the linked list
2. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet with the slow pointer

- remaining problem : **What should be the proper speed for the two pointers?**
